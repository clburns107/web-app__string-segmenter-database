<br>
This is the homepage. It shows a form with a single text field.

<form action="/segmented_text">
  <input type="text" name="smooshed_text">

  <input type="submit">

</form>

Typing some text into that field and submitting the form takes the user to a new page, where the segmented version of their text is displayed.<br>

This page should show a link to an "Admin" page.
<br>
<a href="/admin">Admin Page</a>
